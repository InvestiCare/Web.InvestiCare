                <p class="text2">Investing is the key to building wealth and achieving financial freedom. It allows your money to grow over time, helping you reach big goals like education, a home, or early retirement. Unlike keeping money idle, investing puts it to work, making it grow through returns, interest, and compounding.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text2">No matter how small you start, investing early gives you an advantage. The longer your money stays invested, the more it can grow. With the right knowledge and smart choices, investing can turn small contributions into significant wealth over time.</p>

                    <p class="text3">The stock market allows individuals to buy ownership in companies and earn returns through price appreciation and dividends.</p>

                    <ol class="text4">
                        <li>Individual Stocks – Buying shares of a company like Tata, Reliance, or Infosys makes you a partial owner. If the company performs well, stock prices increase, and you can earn profits.</li>
                        <li>Dividends – Some companies distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends, providing regular income.</li>
                        <li>Growth Stocks – These are stocks of companies that reinvest profits to grow rather than paying dividends, aiming for higher future value.</li>
                        <li>Value Stocks – Stocks that trade at a price lower than their actual worth, often found in undervalued companies.</li>

                        <li>Debt Mutual Funds – Invest in bonds and fixed-income securities, offering stable returns with lower risk</li>
                        <li>Hybrid/Balanced Funds – Invest in both stocks and bonds to balance risk and return.</li>
                        <li>Index Funds – Track a specific market index like NIFTY 50 or SENSEX, offering a low-cost, passive investment strategy.</li>

                        <li>Hybrid/Balanced Funds – Moderate risk, as they invest in both equity and debt to balance returns.</li>
                        <li>Index Funds – Moderate risk, as they track a market index and depend on overall market performance.</li>

                        <li>High Initial Investment – Requires significant capital for purchase, registration, and maintenance.</li>
                        <li>Legal & Regulatory Risks – Issues like unclear property titles, legal disputes, or changing regulations can affect ownership and profitability.</li>
                        <li>Rental Income Uncertainty – Tenants may delay payments, vacate early, or properties may remain unoccupied for long periods.</li>
                        <li>Unexpected Expenses – Repairs, maintenance, property taxes, and renovation costs can reduce overall returns.</li>
